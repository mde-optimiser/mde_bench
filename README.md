# MDE Optimisation benchmark tools

## Questions?

 * How should we benchmark the time?
    Should we run time on the container startup command or rely on the tool builders?
 * Should we run the optimisation model by model, each time in a  separate container?
 
 
 Current output structure:
 
 run-{unixtime}/problem-{}/tool-{}/input-{}/experiment-{}/solution.xmi
